HTML Documents
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.
The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.
The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.
he <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:
HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading:
HTML Paragraphs
HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:
HTML Links
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:
HTML Images
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:
HTML Elements
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
Examples of some HTML elements:
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
Tag	Description
<html>
Defines the root of an HTML document
<body>
Defines the document's body
<h1> to <h6>
Defines HTML headings
Nested HTML Elements
HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):
Empty HTML Elements
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:
Example
HTML is Not Case Sensitive
HTML Attributes
•	All HTML elements can have attributes
•	Attributes provide additional information about elements
•	Attributes are always specified in the start tag
•	Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
•	All HTML elements can have attributes
•	The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
•	The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
•	The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images
•	The alt attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image
•	The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
•	The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
•	The title attribute defines some extra information about an element
•	There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:
•	1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
•	Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.
•	2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
•	Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.
Headings Are Important
Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.
<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.
Bigger Headings
Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:
Example
<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>
HTML Paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
HTML Display
You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:
HTML Horizontal Rules
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page: HTML Line Breaks
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
he HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
Tag	Description
<p>
Defines a paragraph
<hr>
Defines a thematic change in the content
<br>
Inserts a single line break
<pre>
Defines pre-formatted text
HTML Styles:
•	Use the style attribute for styling HTML elements
•	Use background-color for background color
•	Use color for text colors
•	Use font-family for text fonts
•	Use font-size for text sizes
•	Use text-align for text alignment

HTML Styles - CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
What is CSS?
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.
With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
Using CSS
CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
•	Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
•	Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
•	External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.
Inline CSS
An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.
An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.
Internal CSS
An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.
An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element.
The following example sets the text color of ALL the <h1> elements (on that page) to blue, and the text color of ALL the <p> elements to red. In addition, the page will be displayed with a "powderblue" background color:
External CSS
An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.
To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page:
CSS color
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 300%;
}
p {
  color: red;
  font-family: courier;
  font-size: 160%;
}
CSS Border
The CSS border property defines a border around an HTML element.
p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
}
CSS Padding
The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border.
p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
  padding: 30px;
}
CSS Margin
The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border.
p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
  margin: 50px;
}
Link to External CSS
External style sheets can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.
summary
•	Use the HTML style attribute for inline styling
•	Use the HTML <style> element to define internal CSS
•	Use the HTML <link> element to refer to an external CSS file
•	Use the HTML <head> element to store <style> and <link> elements
•	Use the CSS color property for text colors
•	Use the CSS font-family property for text fonts
•	Use the CSS font-size property for text sizes
•	Use the CSS border property for borders
•	Use the CSS padding property for space inside the border
•	Use the CSS margin property for space outside the border

HTML Links - Syntax
The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:
<a href="url">link text</a>
By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
•	An unvisited link is underlined and blue
•	A visited link is underlined and purple
•	An active link is underlined and red
HTML Links - The target Attribute
By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
The target attribute can have one of the following values:
•	_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
•	_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
•	_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
•	_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
Create a Bookmark in HTML
Bookmarks can be useful if a web page is very long.
To create a bookmark - first create the bookmark, then add a link to it.
When the link is clicked, the page will scroll down or up to the location with the bookmark
Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.
A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):
h2>Absolute URLs</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>

<h2>Relative URLs</h2>
<p><a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a></p>
<p><a href="/css/default.asp">CSS Tutorial</a></p>
HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link
To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:
Example
<a href="default.asp">
<img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
</a>
link to an Email Address
Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):
Example
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>
Button as a Link
To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.
JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button:
Example
<button onclick="document.location='def
HTML Images Syntax
The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.
Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.
The <img> tag has two required attributes:
•	src - Specifies the path to the image
•	alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">

HTML Tables
HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.
Table Cells
Each table cell is defined by a <td> and a </td> tag.
td stands for table data.
Everything between <td> and </td> are the content of the table cell.
Table Rows
Each table row starts with a <tr> and end with a </tr> tag.
tr stands for table row.
